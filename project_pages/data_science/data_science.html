                    <p>
                        My team and I created a multi-class classification prediction of damage 
                        sustained by buildings following a magnitude 8 earthquake. The goal of
                        this prediction problem was to address a machine learning problem through an
                        initial model building and model refinement stage as a group project.

                <p>
                    I created a model to predict the birthweight of an infant given a certain set 
                    of characteristics. The goal of this prediction problem was to practice one 
                    complete iteration of the general machine learning framework.

                <p>
                    I explored the relationships between air quality indicators, certain lung 
                    diseases, and how sociodemographic vulnerabilities affect the relationships 
                    between air quality and health in the United States. The goal of this analysis 
                    was to develop skills in data wrangling, visualization, and exploration.

                    My project partner and I created an interactive dashboard visulizing the distribution
                    of the global burden of tuberculosis. The goal of this project was to practice
